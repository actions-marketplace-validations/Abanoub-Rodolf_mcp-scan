**Open-source security scanner for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.**

MCP servers run with full access to your filesystem, API keys, and network. mcp-scan audits every MCP server configuration on your system, detecting leaked secrets, prompt injection risks, supply-chain vulnerabilities, and data flow issues before they become incidents.

```bash
npx mcp-scan@latest
```

No installation. No sign-up. No telemetry. No data leaves your machine. Supply chain scanning makes registry lookups (npm, OSV.dev, GitHub API) - disable with `--offline`.

## Badge

Publish an MCP server yourself? Get a public badge for its README:

```bash
npx mcp-scan badge <your-npm-package-name>
```

Prints a ready-to-paste Markdown snippet linking to a hosted scan report at thynkq.com. The command itself makes no network calls and needs no account, but the badge image is served by thynkq.com and loads whenever someone views the README. Every scan also prints a public report link for each server it found, whether or not you publish it yourself.

## Why mcp-scan?

MCP servers are the new attack surface for AI-powered development. They run silently alongside your AI tools with shell access, filesystem permissions, and network egress. A single malicious or misconfigured server can exfiltrate API keys, inject instructions into your AI sessions, or become a supply-chain entry point.

mcp-scan was built after analyzing hundreds of publicly available MCP server configs and finding patterns that existing security tools miss: credential relay, prompt injection via tool descriptions, typosquatting near popular packages, and data sent to unexpected endpoints.

---

## What It Detects

| Check | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Data Exfiltration | CRITICAL | Tool reads filesystem/DB/clipboard and sends data to a network endpoint |
| Credential Relay | HIGH | Environment variables or secrets passed to external APIs or processes |
| Known Malicious Package | CRITICAL | Config references packages on the known-bad list |
| Exposed Secret | CRITICAL | Hardcoded API keys, tokens, or passwords in config |
| Prompt Injection | HIGH | Instructions embedded in tool names, descriptions, or tool schema fields |
| Obfuscated Network | HIGH | Server uses base64, hex, or reversed URLs to hide endpoints |
| Data-in-URL Exfil | HIGH | Potential exfiltration via long strings in URL query parameters |
| Typosquatting | HIGH | Package name closely resembles a trusted popular package |
| Supply Chain Risk | MEDIUM | Low-trust package with no history, stars, or maintainers |
| PII Exposure | HIGH | Server handles sensitive personal data without proper controls |
| Outdated Package | CRITICAL | Package has known vulnerabilities in the installed version |
| Overly Broad Permissions | HIGH | Server requests filesystem or shell access it does not need |
| Telemetry Tracking | MEDIUM | Server contacts known analytics or tracking domains |
| Privacy Gaps | MEDIUM | Missing data retention, deletion, or encryption-at-rest policies |
| Unverified Source | MEDIUM | Package not from a verified registry or organization, and not published with npm provenance |
| Data Minimization | LOW | Tool requests significantly more data fields than necessary |
| Missing Transport | HIGH | MCP server communicates over unencrypted transport |

## All Commands

```bash
# Full security scan (auto-detects all AI tool configs)
npx mcp-scan@latest

# Output as JSON for CI/CD pipelines
npx mcp-scan@latest --json

npx mcp-scan@latest --ci --severity high

# Interactive TUI dashboard (blessed/blessed-contrib install as optional
# dependencies; if the install was skipped, this prints an install hint)
npx mcp-scan@latest dashboard
```

---

## CI/CD Integration

Add mcp-scan to any CI pipeline via `npx`. Emits SARIF 2.1.0 which GitHub, GitLab, and most security tools pick up:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: 20
  - run: npx mcp-scan@latest --sarif mcp-scan.sarif --severity medium
  - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
    with:
      sarif_file: mcp-scan.sarif
```

GitLab CI, CircleCI, or any runner works. `npx mcp-scan` is the portable entrypoint.

## Custom Security Policies

Define your own rules in `.mcp-scan-policy.yml`:

```yaml
version: 1
rules:
  - id: block-external-secrets
    description: Block any server that leaks secrets to unknown endpoints
    action: block
    match:
      finding_id: ["exposed-secret", "exfiltration-vector"]

  - id: escalate-supply-chain
    description: Treat low-trust packages as critical
    action: override-severity
    severity: critical
    match:
      finding_id: supply-chain-low-trust

  - id: allow-local-network
    description: Skip unknown-endpoint findings for local development
    action: skip
    match:
      finding_id: network-egress-unknown
      category: ["localhost", "127.0.0.1"]

  - id: warn-on-pii
    description: Flag any server that handles card data
    action: warn
    match:
      severity: critical
      pii_types: ["Credit Card"]
```

Rules need `id` + `action` (`block`, `warn`, `skip`, `override-severity`).
Match keys: `server_name`, `finding_id`, `severity`, `category`, `license_type`, `pii_types`.
Validate with `mcp-scan policy validate`.

## Compliance Mapping

| Framework | Controls Covered |
|-----------|-----------------|
| SOC 2 | CC6.1, CC6.6, CC6.7, CC7.1 |
| GDPR | Art. 25, Art. 32, Art. 33 |
| HIPAA | 164.312(a)(1), 164.312(e)(1) |
| PCI-DSS | Req. 6, Req. 10, Req. 11 |
| NIST 800-53 | CA-7, RA-5, SA-11, SI-2 |

## Privacy & Security Architecture

mcp-scan runs locally on your machine. Config parsing, regex scanning, and all heuristics happen in-process. The only network calls are optional supply-chain lookups (npm registry, OSV.dev for CVEs, GitHub API for trust scoring), which can be disabled with `--offline`.

- Local config parsing and analysis only
- No API keys required
- No telemetry, no account, no sign-up
- Optional npm/OSV.dev/GitHub API lookups for supply-chain and CVE scanning, off with `--offline`
- Fully open source. Audit the code yourself.

---

## Roadmap

- **v2.1**: Runtime Monitoring (proxy that inspects live MCP traffic)
- **v2.2**: Sandboxed Execution for scanned servers
- **v2.3**: Real-Time Alerting

## Read

- [The State of MCP Security](https://thynkq.com/writing/state-of-mcp-security-2026-08): ecosystem size, real scan data from a workstation and the official registry, and the incidents behind the headlines.

## Paid next steps

`mcp-scan` itself is free and MIT. When a scan finds something that needs a
decision, two paid options exist. Neither is required to use the scanner:

- **MCP Risk Review**: a human-led, 48-hour review of a real MCP setup by the
  maintainer, with a clear go / fix / escalate recommendation. See
  [thynkq.com/pricing#specialist-review](https://thynkq.com/pricing#specialist-review).
- **mcp-scan Pro waitlist**: hosted reports, policy packs, and buyer-safe risk
  summaries for teams that need a shareable artifact after a local scan. Join at
  [thynkq.com/products/mcp-scan#mcp-pro-waitlist](https://thynkq.com/products/mcp-scan#mcp-pro-waitlist).
