# Changelog

All notable changes to mcp-scan are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.13] - 2026-09-07

### Changed
- Terminal output shows config paths under your home directory as `~`
  instead of the full path. JSON, SARIF, HTML, and audit-log output are
  unaffected, still absolute.
- Fixed the header box border misaligning in most terminals (a double-width
  emoji threw off the padding math).

### Added
- A one-line, once-per-machine hint after a scan finds something: mcp-scan
  is maintained by one person, a star helps others find it. Only prints on
  a real terminal, never under `--json`, `--sarif`, CI, or piped output.
  Silence it permanently with `MCP_SCAN_NO_HINTS=1`.

## [2.0.12] - 2026-09-05

### Changed
- Registry scanner checks npm provenance attestations before flagging a package as
  unverified. A package published with `npm publish --provenance` now gets an INFO
  `provenance-verified` finding instead of `unverified-source`. Packages without
  provenance still get `unverified-source`, now at MEDIUM (unscoped) or LOW (scoped)
  instead of HIGH/MEDIUM, since name-based unverified checks alone were flagging
  most of npm, including mcp-scan's own package.
- `blessed` and `blessed-contrib` (the TUI dashboard's terminal-rendering
  libraries) moved from `dependencies` to `optionalDependencies`. They're
  still installed by default for `npx`/CLI users, but `import { runScan }
  from 'mcp-scan'` no longer pulls in 2MB of terminal-UI packages (and
  their `xml2js` transitive) for consumers who never touch the dashboard.
  `mcp-scan dashboard` and `proxy --ui` now print an install hint and exit
  1 instead of crashing if the optional install was skipped.

### Added
- `mcp-scan badge <package>` prints the README badge markdown and report link
  for a package's hosted check at thynkq.com; `scan` now ends with the same
  report hint for the scanned package.

### Fixed
- npm provenance publishing works again: `repository.url` must name the GitHub
  repo the release workflow runs in, or the registry rejects the sigstore
  bundle (the 2.0.11 tag never reached npm for this reason).

## [2.0.11] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed
- data-controls: config file paths no longer scanned for PII.

## [2.0.10] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- A one-line pointer to the GitHub repo after a `scan` that finds at least one
  issue. Shown once per machine ever (marker in `~/.mcp-scan`), TTY-only,
  never in `--json`, `--sarif`, or `ci` output, silenced permanently with
  `MCP_SCAN_NO_HINTS=1`.

## [2.0.9] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- `report` no longer drops dotfile configs from its glob scan. fast-glob excludes
  dotfiles by default, which silently skipped `.mcp.json`, the single most common
  MCP config filename. The command could report "found N config files" while
  scanning none of the servers those configs defined.
- Licenses are no longer reported missing when the registry lookup falls back to
  offline mode.
- Placeholder credentials in example configs are no longer flagged CRITICAL.
- Vulnerability matching compares the resolved version against the advisory range
  instead of matching on package name alone.

## [2.0.8] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- The scan footer now links the rules reference at thynkq.com/docs/mcp-scan/rules
  when findings exist. Every rule id has a page there: what triggers it, when it
  is a false positive, and how to fix it, the same URLs SARIF `helpUri` has
  always carried, live for the first time.

## [2.0.7] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- A one-line pointer to the hosted report option after high-intent commands
  (`compliance`, `sbom`, `policy show`, and a failed `ci` gate, on stderr).
  TTY-only, never in JSON or SARIF output, silenced permanently with
  `MCP_SCAN_NO_HINTS=1`. The scanner itself stays free and unchanged.

## [2.0.6] - 2026-08-23

### Security
- Dependency audit: bumped undici (7 high advisories), uuid, and vite
  (2 high advisories) past their patched versions; rebuilt the GitHub
  Actions bundle with them inline.
- Accepted residual risks, upstream-blocked: lodash high via
  `blessed-contrib` (affects only the interactive dashboard TUI, no
  patched upstream exists yet) and esbuild low (dev-only, Windows dev
  server). Revisit when upstream releases land.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed
- `ci --max-severity` now fails on LOW and INFO findings as documented;
  previously the flag silently ignored both severities.
- CLI severity colors: HIGH was rendered in critical red and MEDIUM in
  high orange. All surfaces (CLI, HTML, dashboard, spinner) now share one
  palette.
- An INFO-only scan printed "All clear" in the terminal while HTML and
  Slack reported "N findings detected". The all-clear check now counts
  every severity everywhere.
- Slack webhook: a rejected fetch leaked the 10s abort timer; transport
  is now unified with an always-cleared timeout helper.
- `mcp-scan fix`: url-based `http-transport-no-auth` and `insecure-transport`
  servers were detected but never remediated; both are fixed now. Servers
  carrying an insecure scheme in args AND url get both rewritten.
- LOW findings render green (the shared palette) in HTML and terminal
  badges instead of gray; the terminal summary row keeps its dim styling.
- Library note: `ScanOptions.fix` was removed from the public type. The
  interactive fix flow is CLI-only (`mcp-scan fix` / `--fix`); passing it
  to `runScan` had become a silent no-op, which is now a visible compile
  error for TypeScript consumers.
- With `MCP_SCAN_HOME` set, custom rules now load from that home; a
  warning points at legacy rules left in `~/.mcp-scan/rules`.
- SBOM: CycloneDX component purls are built by one function so
  vulnerability `affects[].ref` joins cannot silently break; corrected a
  wrong repository URL.
- Two type errors that made plain `tsc --noEmit` fail (invisible to tsup
  builds) are fixed.

### Changed
- Finding ids live in one list: the `FindingId` union is derived from it,
  replacing a hand-maintained duplicate that had already drifted.
- Severity tallying is shared by scan/report/audit/submit instead of five
  divergent inline chains (scan also tallied twice per run).
- fetch timeout handling unified across package scanner, doctor, submit,
  and webhooks; offline CVE snapshot read through one loader that warns on
  parse failures instead of failing silently.
- Custom rules directory honors `MCP_SCAN_HOME` at call time (previously
  frozen to the real home dir at module load); rule file read failures are
  no longer misreported as parse failures.
- Tool config paths generated from one declarative table (adding a tool is
  one entry); proven byte-equivalent across 24 platform/home/env combos.
- Compliance command computes one assessment consumed by console, CSV,
  JSON, and Markdown renderers; outputs verified byte-identical.
- Config parsing boundary typed honestly (`RawMcpServerEntry`), removing
  `as any` casts in parser and fix paths.

### Added
- 26 new tests: real abort-path coverage for OSV.dev timeouts (the old test
  slept 4 real seconds without testing the timeout), unit coverage for the
  Levenshtein typosquatting math, scan-text surface builder, CI threshold
  matrix, and auto-fix strategies.

### Security
- No detection patterns or thresholds changed; every scanner emits exactly
  as before (verified by the full suite plus golden output diffs).

## [2.0.4] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- npm `funding` field: exposes the GitHub Sponsors link on the npm package
  page. Metadata-only release.

### Security
- Prompt-injection and tool-poisoning scanners now evaluate the full tool
  catalog: tool names, descriptions, and nested JSON schema description/
  enum values. The 2026 MCP threat model treats the catalog as part of
  the prompt, so payloads hide in schema fields, not just descriptions.
- SARIF output: rule table aligned with the ids scanners actually emit
  (dead `malicious-package`/`typosquatting-package`/etc. keys removed),
  `originalUriBaseIds` declared so `%SRCROOT%` resolves for GitHub code
  scanning, POSIX URI separators on Windows, dead account URL fixed.
- Compliance mappings aligned to emitted finding ids (`known-malicious`,
  `typosquat-detection`, `supply-chain-low-trust`, `server-mutation`, ...)
  so SOC 2 / GDPR / HIPAA / PCI-DSS / NIST controls actually match.

### Fixed
- Library API: `ScanOptions` is now a single source of truth shared by
  the CLI, `runScan`, and the public entry; HTML/SARIF/SBOM generators
  are exported from the library.
- Proxy `--args` parsing respects quotes and commas instead of naive
  split-on-space, so multi-word values work.
- GitHub Action runner moved from the deprecated `node20` to `node24`;
  pre-commit hook declares the npm dependency so the `mcp-scan` entry
  resolves.
- `audit` command uses exit codes instead of `process.exit`.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-08-15

### Security fixes (end-to-end audit)
- Stored XSS closed in HTML reports: every server-controlled string (tool descriptions, finding text, config paths) is now HTML-escaped.
- Command injection closed in `mcp-scan doctor`: `which`/`where` now run via `spawnSync` with an argument array instead of a shell string.
- Proxy no longer writes raw unmasked JSON-RPC payloads to disk: masking happens before logging, and the log dir honors `MCP_SCAN_LOG_DIR`.
- Secret scanner: prefix-less formats (Pinecone/Heroku UUIDs, Cloudflare/Railway/Together bare strings) are only reported when the env var key names the provider; added `github_pat_`, `rk_live_`, `whsec_` formats; non-string env values no longer crash scans; URL-decoded values are matched; `server.url` credentials are scanned.
- PII scanner: fixed the `/g` + `.test()` lastIndex bug that silently disabled PII detection from the second server on; credit cards require a Luhn-valid number; private/loopback IPs are excluded; bare 24-64 char "API key" detection removed; keyword terms are word-boundary and restricted to descriptive text.
- CVE scanner: OSV findings with CVSS v4 vectors or plain numeric scores are no longer silently dropped; upgrade advice was inverted and is fixed; offline snapshot severity mapping is exhaustive.
- `--ci` is the only mode that exits 1 on CRITICAL/HIGH findings; a plain interactive scan reports without failing the shell.
- Scanner failures are isolated per scanner (LOW `scanner-error` finding) instead of aborting the whole run.

### Fixed
- JSONC parser: state-machine comment/trailing-comma stripping no longer corrupts URLs containing `,}` or `//` inside strings.
- `fix` command preserves file permissions, symlinks, and keeps a timestamped backup instead of making 0600 files world-readable.
- `ci --output` works and `ci` forwards `--config`/`--policy`/`--offline`; `privacy --output` is now a real option; dead `sbom --include-deps` flag removed.
- `audit` deep-checks the audited server, not the first scanned one; `report` surfaces per-file failures instead of swallowing them.
- CVE snapshot regenerated from live OSV/npm data (74 packages, real advisories, no test fixture, fresh `updatedAt`).

### Added
- GitHub Actions CI matrix for Node 20/22 with job timeouts, an npm audit gate, and an npm publish workflow with provenance on version tags.
- Test suite is hermetic: scans redirect the audit store (`MCP_SCAN_HOME`) to a temp dir, CI tests run `--offline`, and a regression test covers the env-leak relative-path hang.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- Hermetic, machine-portable golden-file tests (no absolute paths, no timestamps).
- Pinned `lodash` to 4.17.21 exactly; npm audit gate set to critical-only (blessed-contrib's transitive lodash advisories are documented as accepted residual risk in SEMVER-IMPACT.md).
- Include `data/` in GitLab CI build artifacts; drop Node 18 from the CI matrix (vitest 4 requires Node 20+).
- `.env.local`, `.env.production`, `.env.development`, `.env.staging` variants scanned by the env-leak scanner.
- Data-controls scanner: restored token-class API Key keywords.
- Library API: `sbom` option is a path string, not a boolean.
- Repository URLs pointed at the GitLab user namespace.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- Version bump for npm SEO metadata; v2.0 platform shipped as 2.0.x.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Data Flow Analyzer**: traces data from sensitive sources (filesystem, clipboard, keychain, screen capture) to network sinks (HTTP, email/SMTP), with cross-server flow detection.
- **Network Egress Monitor**: flags suspicious endpoints, obfuscated URLs (base64/hex/reversed), raw IPs, non-standard ports, and telemetry/tracking domains; 8 additional AI provider endpoints, 8 tunneling endpoints, and 7 telemetry endpoints.
- **Privacy Assessment**: PII detection (email, phone, cards, SSN, IBAN, IPv4/IPv6, MAC, passport, driver license, NPI, VAT, AWS account), data minimization checks, and `mcp-scan privacy` reports.
- **Compliance Mapping**: SOC 2 (CC6.1, CC6.6, CC6.7, CC7.1, CC9.1, A1.1), GDPR (Art. 13, 25, 32, 33), HIPAA (164.308, 164.312), PCI-DSS (Req 6, 10, 11, 12), NIST 800-53 (CA-7, RA-5, SA-11, SI-2, RS.MI-1, PR.IP-1) with per-framework scores.
- **SARIF 2.1.0 output** for GitHub/GitLab code scanning, plus a GitHub Action (`Abanoub-Rodolf/mcp-scan`).
- **Policy Engine**: `.mcp-scan-policy.yml` rules (skip, block, warn, override-severity) and `.mcp-scan.json` project config.
- **SBOM generation**: CycloneDX v1.5 and SPDX 2.3 output.
- Scanner and data expansions: `/.etc`, `/var`, `/usr` dangerous paths; `.kube`, `.docker`, `.npmrc`, `.netrc`, ssh keys sensitive paths; bearer/cert/pem/keypair credential env patterns; IPv6/MAC PII masking; 13 additional trusted community servers; entropy-based secret detection; tool-poisoning and capability-injection scanner.
- `.env` file variants, offline mode with a bundled CVE snapshot, webhook/Slack alerting, `mcp-scan history`, `mcp-scan diff`, `mcp-scan doctor`, `mcp-scan report`, `mcp-scan audit`, watch mode with delta reporting, and a blessed TUI dashboard.
